    <p>Doctors is the largest professional medical network for U.S. healthcare professionals, with more than 80% of US doctors and 50% of all NPs and physician assistants as members. Clinicians can use Doctors on their iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Android device or computer to securely connect and collaborate with other healthcare professionals about patient treatment, identify appropriate experts for patient referrals, and manage their careers.

    <p>Despite the finite nature of health care resources, advances in technology —
        from virtual care solutions to remote patient monitoring devices — have forged
        a new, more flexible path for remote health care delivery, or mobile medicine,
        with telemedicine at the forefront. With telemedicine, patients can now receive
        medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the
        comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical
        barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.
        </p>
        <p>This report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications
            across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician
            well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88%
            of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to
            health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence
            to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a considerable portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved
            their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings
            of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care,
            telemedicine may also be increasing patients’ willingness to seek medical
            attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more
            likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience
            and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. </p>
        <p>Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85%
            said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority
            reporting increased satisfaction. </p>
        <p>As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to maintain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care
            are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand
            access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and implementation of best practices, telemedicine’s capacity to personalize care
            models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only
            get stronger.</p>
